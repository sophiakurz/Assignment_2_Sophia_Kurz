# Assignment 2: Exploration and Analysis of Misogynistic Insults vs Neutral Insults

For this assignement, I decided to examine if there was a difference in scoring for insults that are generally deemed to be misogynistic and targeted towards self-identifying women (I chose the terms: 'bitch', 'whore', 'slutty', 'skank', and 'tramp') and insults that are generally deemed to be either neutral or targeted towards self-identifying men (I chose the terms: 'dickhead', 'bastard', 'jackass', 'asshole','prick').

My hypothesis was a little difficult to solidify. On the one hand, Wikipedia is primarily used by men, misoginy might be a reason for traditionally female-targeted insults to be scored lower than neutral/male-geared. But, on the other hand, fragile masculinity might explain why men perhaps being called traditionally female insults would score higher, because it might imply that they are percieved as women, and therefore, recieve a higher toxicity score.

What was interesting is that, when exploring the whole CSV file, I struggled to determine a true threshhold for the labels. By this, I mean that sometimes, one comment that scored higher than another wasn't deemed offensive in any regard, compared to one that scored lower and was deemed offensive. EXAMPLE:

I finally settled on a hypothesis that female-targeted insults would score hugher than male-targeted insults, mostly due to the notion of fragile masculinity and partly to do with the fact that women are more likely to report offensive comments than men are, er go comments including language that are specifically targeted towards their gender identity.
